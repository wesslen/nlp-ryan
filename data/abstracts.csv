"Anchoring effect is the tendency to focus too heavily on one piece of information when making decisions. In this paper, we present a novel, systematic study and resulting analyses that investigate the effects of anchoring effect on human decision-making using visual analytic systems. Visual analytics interfaces typically contain multiple views that present various aspects of information such as spatial, temporal, and categorical. These views are designed to present complex, heterogeneous data in accessible forms that aid decisionmaking. However, human decision-making is often hindered by the use of heuristics, or cognitive biases, such as anchoring effect. Anchoring effect can be triggered by the order in which information is presented or the magnitude of information presented. Through carefully designed laboratory experiments, we present evidence of anchoring effect in analysis with visual analytics interfaces when users are primed by representation of different pieces of information. We also describe detailed analyses of users’ interaction logs which reveal the impact of anchoring bias on the visual representation preferred and paths of analysis. We discuss implications for future research to possibly detect and alleviate anchoring bias.","The Anchoring Effect in Decision-Making with Visual Analytics","Visual Analytics"
"Cognitive biases have been shown to lead to faulty decision-making. Recent research has demonstrated that the effect of cognitive biases, anchoring bias in particular, transfers to information visualization and visual analytics. However, it is still unclear how users of visual interfaces can be anchored and the impact of anchoring on user performance and decision-making process. To investigate, we performed two rounds of between-subjects, in-laboratory experiments with 94 participants to analyze the effect of visual anchors and strategy cues in decision-making with a visual analytic system that employs coordinated multiple view design. The decision-making task is identifying misinformation from Twitter news accounts. Participants were randomly assigned one of three treatment groups (including control) in which participant training processes were modified. Our findings reveal that strategy cues and visual anchors (scenario videos) can significantly affect user activity, speed, confidence, and, under certain circumstances, accuracy. We discuss the implications of our experiment results on training users how to use a newly developed visual interface. We call for more careful consideration into how visualization designers and researchers train users to avoid unintentionally anchoring users and thus affecting the end result.

"Topic models are a family of statistical-based algorithms to summarize, explore and index large collections of text documents. After a decade of research led by computer scientists, topic models have spread to social science as a new generation of data-driven social scientists have searched for tools to explore large collections of unstructured text. Recently, social scientists have contributed to topic model literature with developments in causal inference and tools for handling the problem of multi-modality. In this paper, I provide a literature review on the evolution of topic modeling including extensions for document covariates, methods for evaluation and interpretation, and advances in interactive visualizations along with each aspect's relevance and application for social science research.","Computer-Assisted Text Analysis for Social Science: Topic Models and Beyond","Text"
"Social media data bear valuable insights regarding events that occur around the world. Events are inherently temporal and spatial. Existing visual text analysis systems have focused on detecting and analyzing past and ongoing events. Few have leveraged social media information to look for events that may occur in the future. In this paper, we present an interactive visual analytic system, CrystalBall, that automatically identifies and ranks future events from Twitter streams. CrystalBall integrates new methods to discover events with interactive visualizations that permit sensemaking of the identified future events. Our computational methods integrate seven different measures to identify and characterize future events, leveraging information regarding time, location, social networks, and the informativeness of the messages. A visual interface is tightly coupled with the computational methods to present a concise summary of the possible future events. A novel connection graph and glyphs are designed to visualize the characteristics of the future events. To demonstrate the efficacy of CrystalBall in identifying future events and supporting interactive analysis, we present multiple case studies and validation studies on analyzing events derived from Twitter data.","CrystalBall: A Visual Analytic System for Future Event Discovery and Analysis from Social Media Data","Social Media"
"As a result of globalization, large-scale modern-day businesses extend across borders as they engage in multinational enterprises. Such enterprises must conduct operations in disparate, culturally diverse contexts, which present challenges for implementing human resource management activities, such as whether to standardize or localize activities across borders. The current study focuses on recruitment activities, as they represent firms’ initial efforts to attract highly qualified talent. However, the extant recruitment literature has primarily been conducted in a single context or in Westernized societies; thus, it is unclear how organizations recruit across borders. Drawing on signaling theory, we explore how Fortune 1000 firms use recruiting signals in their domestic and international operations. In general, we find that firms standardize the recruiting signals across their domestic and international operations. Yet, the amount that each signal is emphasized differs in domestic and international operations and is contingent upon language. Furthermore, cultural distance between the home and host country largely does not explain the standardization of the recruiting signals. We summarize the findings and provide direction intended to guide future research.","Strategic Recruitment Across Borders: An Investigation of Multinational Enterprises","Text"
"We present Verifi, a visual analytic system to support the investigation of misinformation on social media. On the one hand, social media platforms empower individuals and organizations by democratizing the sharing of information. On the other hand, even well-informed and experienced social media users are vulnerable to misinformation. To address the issue, various models and studies have emerged from multiple disciplines to detect and understand the effects of misinformation. However, there is still a lack of intuitive and accessible tools that help social media users distinguish misinformation from verified news. In this paper, we present Verifi, a visual analytic system that uses state-of-the-art computational methods to highlight salient features from text, social network, and images. By exploring news on a source level through multiple coordinated views in Verifi, users can interact with the complex dimensions that characterize misinformation and contrast how real and suspicious news outlets differ on these dimensions. To evaluate Verifi, we conduct interviews with experts in digital media, journalism, education, psychology, and computing who study misinformation. Our interviews show promising potential for Verifi to serve as an educational tool on misinformation. Furthermore, our interview results highlight the complexity of the problem of combating misinformation and call for more work from the visualization community.","Vulnerable to misinformation?

"This study presents the Social Media Cognitive Processing model, which explains and predicts the depth of processing on social media based on three classic concepts from the offline literature about cognitive processing: self-generation, psychological distance, and self-reference. Together, these three dimensions have tremendous explanatory power in predicting the depth of processing a receiver will have in response to a sender’s message. Moreover, the model can be used to explain and predict the direction and degree of information proliferation. This model can be used in a variety of contexts (e.g., isolating influencers to persuade others about the merits of vaccination, to dispel fake news, or to spread political messages). We developed the model in the context of Brexit tweets.","Using Information Processing Strategies to Predict Contagion of Social Media Behavior: A Theoretical Model","Social Media"
"We describe a novel longitudinal study of the frequency and significance of social media users' profile changes. Drawing upon two formative theories from communication and psychology: self-construal and signaling theory, we examine the likelihood that users will change their profiles and what constitutes a significant profile change. Our findings indicate that users are more likely to change their Profile Summaries and Display Names than their Locations and Screen Names (ie handles). Further, we used topic modeling to partition users based on their profiles to identify themes and explored how profile changes differ among these thematic groups (eg, Trump supporters). Last, we identified the most significant word changes by users in their profiles. Our findings provide valuable baseline data for further study of Twitter profiles, including the spread of social contagion through these profiles.","Bumper Stickers on the Twitter Highway: Analyzing the Speed and Substance of Profile Changes","Social Media"
"We describe a novel study of decision-making processes around misinformation on social media. Using a custom-built visual analytic system, we presented users with news content from social media accounts from a variety of news outlets, including outlets engaged in distributing misinformation. We conducted controlled experiments to study decision-making regarding the veracity of these news outlets and tested the role of confirmation bias (the tendency to ignore contradicting information) and uncertainty of information on human decision-making processes. Our findings reveal that the presence of conflicting information, presented to users in the form of cues, impacts the ability to judge the veracity of news in systematic ways. We also find that even instructing participants to explicitly disconfirm given hypotheses does not significantly impact their decision-making regarding misinformation when compared to a control condition. Our findings have the potential to inform the design of visual analytics systems so that they may be used to mitigate the effects of cognitive biases and stymie the spread of misinformation on social media.","Can You Verifi This?

"In recent decades, the amount of text available for organizational science research has grown tremendously. Despite the availability of text and advances in text analysis methods, many of these techniques remain largely segmented by discipline. Moreover, there is an increasing number of open-source tools (R, Python) for text analysis, yet these tools are not easily taken advantage of by social science researchers who likely have limited programming knowledge and exposure to computational methods. In this article, we compare quantitative and qualitative text analysis methods used across social sciences. We describe basic terminology and the overlooked, but critically important, steps in pre-processing raw text (e.g., selection of stop words; stemming). Next, we provide an exploratory analysis of open-ended responses from a prototypical survey dataset using topic modeling with R. We provide a list of best practice recommendations for text analysis focused on (1) hypothesis and question formation, (2) design and data collection, (3) data pre-processing, and (4) topic modeling. We also discuss the creation of scale scores for more traditional correlation and regression analyses.

"This study harnesses the power of a big data approach to analyzing the tweets posted to the hashtags used during the Charlotte protests while capitalizing on the advantage of a rhetorical lens for a deep examination of interesting data that emerged from the quantitative analysis. This study involved an analysis of 1.3 million tweets sourced through a proprietary Twitter firehose (Gnip Historical PowerTrack API). The quantitative analysis resulted in our focus on three organizations that engaged in a tactic we refer to as cluster tweets. We used both a big data analysis and rhetorical analysis to obtain insights about cluster tweets and the other tweets used by the three organizations. Where possible, we reported results-oriented information to provide insights and research-based interpretations of the results of public relations strategies and tactics. In addition, we examined hashtag names for the Charlotte protests to contribute to science-based knowledge about hashtag creation and popularity that could apply to similar situations.","From Cluster Tweets to Retweets: A Big Data, Rhetorical Exploration of Digital Social Advocacy in the Context of the Charlotte Protests on Twitter","Text"
"Many visual analytics tools exist to assist users in examining large amounts of information at once via coordinated views that include graphs, network connections and maps. However, the cognitive processes that those users undergo while using such tools remain a mystery. Many psychological studies suggest that individuals may undergo some planning stage followed by analysis before finally making conclusions when examining large amounts of analytical data with the goal of reaching a decision. While the general order of these cognitive states has been theorized, the exact states of individuals at specific points during their interaction with visual analytic systems remain unclear. In this work, we developed models to determine the cognitive states of users based solely on their interactions with the visual analytics systems via Hidden Markov Models. Hidden Markov Models allow for the classification of observations through hidden states (cognitive states in our case) as well as the prediction of future cognitive states.  We generate these models through unsupervised learning and use established metrics such as AIC and BIC metrics to evaluate our models. Our solutions are designed to help improve visual analytics tools by providing a better understanding of cognitive thought processes of users during data intensive analysis tasks.","Using Hidden Markov Models to Determine Cognitive States of Visual Analytic Users","Visual Analytics"
"This paper examines YouTube videos of acceptance speeches from the 2018 Golden Globes. These speeches were coded for charismatic leadership tactics (CLTs), and the comments were analyzed using topic modeling. Using a Poisson regression, we found that women received more comments praising their speech when holding charismatic signaling and fame constant. Fame was related to praising comments, but in the negative direction. CLT use failed to predict praising comments after controlling for other study variables.","She’s got the “it” factor: Do female leaders get credit for their charisma?","Text"
